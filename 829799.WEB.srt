0
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,615
Hey, let me out.

1
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,118
Open up!

2
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,122
Hey, open up!

3
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,962
<i>This is Ryan. Leave a message.</i>

4
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,496
Little Swann, it's me.

5
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,232
We haven't talked much
in a while.

6
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:48,269
Wanna give you some advice.

7
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:50,938
You wanna be
in this fucked up business,

8
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:54,175
you need a partner
to watch your back.

9
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:58,079
Yeah, I had a guy once,
Robbie Cole.

10
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:02,083
Wish I trusted him,
it's a little late for that now.

11
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,151
You are a good kid.

12
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,685
Yeah, I love you, son.

13
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,689
I gotta go.

14
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:19,200
Put down your weapon!

15
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,040
Now!

16
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:30,244
The 1873 supreme court
ruled when bail is reached,

17
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:35,249
the bail bondsmen can exercise
the rights of the court.

18
00:03:35,282 --> 00:03:38,518
My name is Ian Swann.
This man is my prisoner.

19
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,241
Hold your fire!

20
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:28,936
Thanks.

Hi, Robbie.
What are you doing here?

32
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,799
Hey, Nikki. Have a seat.

33
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:01,102
Just working.

34
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,369
On your bar tab?

35
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,636
That too.

36
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,008
I got a jumper
on an auto theft rap.

37
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:12,246
Supposed to be
on the beach today.

38
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,756
Well, if you're looking
for koa kahale

39
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,249
you're not gonna find him here.

40
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,383
Well, you know him?

41
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,852
I know his family.

42
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,253
His mom works at the club.

43
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,855
You know where he is today?

44
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,859
Well, I might.

45
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:27,294
But I want something in return.

46
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,196
Oh yeah,
what do you have in mind?

47
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,397
Six bullets.

48
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,299
What?

49
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,268
Koa's a good kid.

50
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,146
Getting busted might just be
the wakeup call he needs

51
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:39,073
but I don't wanna see him
get hurt.

52
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:43,244
Look, I'm a pro, Nikki.
I've never lost a client yet.

53
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,745
The bullets, Robbie.

54
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:48,916
You serious, huh?

55
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:56,991
Alright. Here you go.
You happy now?

56
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,126
He's trained to fight MMA today.

57
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,163
They're set up down the beach
by the banyan trees.

58
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,832
MMA fighter, huh?

59
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,799
This should be interesting.

60
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,469
You can have these back later
tonight.

61
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,137
Drink's on me.

62
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,381
That sounds good,
but if I have a problem,

63
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,974
unarmed, that's on you too.

64
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,194
<i>It's another beautiful day
in paradise.</i>

65
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,753
<i>It's wb radio Maui.</i>

66
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,457
<i>Morning news local businessman
Thomas Kane in today's...</i>

67
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,093
<i>Just reminding you all
to get out there and vote.</i>

68
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,907
Nobody near the cages unless
they want to get their ass beat.

69
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,376
Now, where's your
aloha spirit, bro?

70
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,314
I'm just here to deliver
a little something to uh...

71
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,015
Koa kahale.

72
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,119
Yeah, that's him.

73
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,889
No, no, no.
Not now, not today, man.

74
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,460
I know this guy.
He's not even a real cop.

75
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,897
Manu. You still collecting
outstanding warrants?

76
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,966
Those ain't lotto
tickets, buddy.

77
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,766
We're protected.

78
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,970
Take one more step
and see what happens.

79
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:19,073
Well, here I am.
And here's my protection.

80
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:22,775
Your fighter is now under
my legal jurisdiction. Period.

81
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,078
How bad do you want him?

82
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,280
Me? Not that bad.

83
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:30,217
But Maui pd, they want the
idiot who uh, skipped bail

84
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:33,020
before joy-riding
in their cruiser.

85
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,955
My mom's got heart problems.

86
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,390
I had to get her to the hospital

87
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,125
and that cop car
was just sitting there.

88
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,792
I was like,
what's the big difference

89
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,328
between an ambulance
and a cop car?

90
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:43,297
That is so incredibly dumb.

91
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,466
I actually believe it's true.

92
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,070
Come on. There's a ufc scout coming, man.
This is my day.

93
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,414
Look, you're either gonna come
with me now

94
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,307
or I'm gonna call it in.

95
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,118
But Maui pd ain't gonna let
you leave this beach

96
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,578
without tearing your acl,
that's for sure.

97
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:01,949
Maybe, just maybe,
you let the kid fight today.

98
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,151
Then after, he comes in
without a fuss.

99
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,552
Think you can do that?

100
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,354
Maybe.

101
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:10,424
One question.
You gonna win in the second?

102
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:13,961
Get it on.

103
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,375
Let's hear it
for our beautiful ring girl.

104
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,481
Round two. Fighters in position.

105
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:38,952
Hey.

106
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,487
Put another 20 on koa.

107
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,324
And let's fight!

108
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,391
Hit him, hit him.

109
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,594
Koa is dancing.

110
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,708
The less experienced fighter
feeling the veteran out.

111
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,934
Come on, koa!

112
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,550
This is the kid
I told you about.

113
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,318
Will be good to have
on our crew.

114
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,994
Kahale's in trouble.

115
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:23,430
Let's go! Finish him.

116
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:29,970
Goddammit, finish him!

117
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,142
Whoa. There it is.

118
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:36,577
Kahale has broken in
a choke hold.

119
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,047
Koa has taken out.

120
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,485
The match goes to koa kahale!
Let's hear it for koa.

121
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,387
Nice, koa.

122
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,454
Beautiful.

123
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:02,403
I'm so proud.

124
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,204
It's all for you, ma.

125
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:06,173
- Time to go, koa.
- Police!

126
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,509
Koa kahale!
Hands where I can see them.

127
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:10,944
Easy, honey. He's my collar.

128
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,479
Don't call me honey, Robbie.

129
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:14,348
Savannah, you know the drill.
Alright?

130
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,450
You can't arrest him
if he's already in my custody.

131
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,252
Then why isn't he in cuffs?

132
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,686
I got this under control.

133
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,121
Yeah, I'm with him!

134
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,556
This is bullshit, Robbie!

135
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,558
You give your profession
a bad name.

136
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,660
Says the cop pointing a gun
at an unarmed perp.

137
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:29,329
You got a warrant? Show it or
get the fuck out of my ring.

138
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,231
If this is your ring,

139
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,966
then you're harboring
an escaped felon.

140
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,401
I can pull your license

141
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,079
and shut down
this little shit show for good.

142
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,639
Guys, take it down...
Look, you spooked him!

143
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,040
Don't even blame me!

144
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,508
Hey! Hey! Stop!

145
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,351
Hey!

146
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,500
Hey, relax. Hey, relax!

147
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,535
One move and I'll light you up
like new year's Eve.

148
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,074
Hey!

149
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:15,718
I saw you in pursuit.
Looked like you needed a hand.

150
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:18,145
Oh yeah? No, I had him. Thanks.

151
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,446
I'm the arresting officer.

152
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:25,786
You're Robbie Cole, right?
You knew my dad.

153
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,054
Who is this?

154
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,123
You're Ian Swann's son?

155
00:11:37,064 --> 00:11:39,733
Alright, Bernie,
koa kahale was my bounty.

156
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,768
Tell the paymaster
to have my check ready.

157
00:11:41,803 --> 00:11:44,404
Your commission
is a standard 10% of bail.

158
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,807
That's 100 bucks, man.

159
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,376
What? 10% of
10,000 is a grand, buddy.

160
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,712
There was a typo.
His bail is actually a $1,000.

161
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,680
I mean, the kid
is not exactly El chapo.

162
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,652
Happy now?

163
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:02,289
No. Barely covered my bar tab.

164
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:05,425
Ryan, meet Savannah tui,
homicide detective.

165
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,327
Don't get fooled
by her pretty face.

166
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:08,762
She's a real pit-bull.

167
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,398
I love you too, Robbie.

168
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:14,234
So, you're Ian Swann's son?
I'm sorry for your loss.

169
00:12:14,268 --> 00:12:15,708
I've been on the case
from the start.

170
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,504
Then you must have
some idea who did it.

171
00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:20,340
Look, Ryan, your dad and I
used to work together.

172
00:12:20,374 --> 00:12:22,142
He made a lot of enemies
on this island.

173
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:24,511
Yeah. He had that effect
on people, so?

174
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,613
If anything, what we've got
is too many suspects.

175
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,825
Yeah, well gimme a list,
I'll run 'em down.

176
00:12:27,849 --> 00:12:29,449
You're not a cop.

177
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,518
Yeah, I'm better than a cop.
Fewer rules.

178
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,855
Oh, shit.
Another bounty hunter?

179
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:36,790
This island's way too small
for another ass-kicking cowboy.

180
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:39,226
Yeah. Well, if that's
what you thought of my dad,

181
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,460
then you've got him all wrong,

182
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:41,638
which means
you'll never solve shit.

183
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,163
Hey.

184
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:44,731
Savannah's the last cop
on this island

185
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,400
that actually gives a damn.

186
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,368
You're gonna want her
on your side.

187
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:49,804
Give us a little time, Ryan.

188
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:51,214
Why don't you take
a couple of days off

189
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,606
and enjoy our beaches, okay?

190
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,811
What did dad do to get himself...

191
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,580
Hey, you got daddy issues?
Don't talk about him here.

192
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:01,883
I know a good, quiet place.
Hannah's bar.

193
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,750
You're a smart kid,
you'll find it.

194
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,452
Meet me there at four.

195
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:19,433
Go ahead.

196
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,471
Oh, jeez.

197
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:27,641
I know. Sharks.

198
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,242
That... that isn't much
of a body.

199
00:13:29,276 --> 00:13:31,178
It's... it's just...

200
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,246
The body wasn't recovered
for at least 24 hours.

201
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:37,250
The DNA was a match
to his Chicago pd records.

202
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,656
They recovered a few things
from his car,

203
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,658
including his ID.
It's over there.

204
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,166
Yeah. Yeah, that's uh...

205
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:59,773
That's him.

206
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,745

210
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,723
So, he left you a message
same day he got killed?

211
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:19,226
He must have known
he wasn't gonna make it.

212
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,862
Told me to contact you.

213
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:23,363
That figures.

214
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:24,866
He always thought
I owed him one,

215
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,467
but he was wrong
about that shit.

216
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,736
What do you say
we make it interesting?

217
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,405
Wanna 20 to the winner?

218
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,579
Nice.

219
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:40,781
Thanks.

220
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,350
Your dad was the real deal.

221
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,419
Little hard to handle sometime.

222
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,653
Yeah, tell me about it.

223
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,724
He was hell of a bounty hunter,
though.

224
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,793
Best I'd ever seen.
And a good partner.

225
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:57,497
'Course, then there was
that little misunderstanding

226
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,833
about your mom and I.

227
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:02,269
Wait, that was you?

228
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,973
I ain't proud of it,
but shit happens.

229
00:15:06,007 --> 00:15:08,608
Hey, shit happens.
They got divorced over it.

230
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:12,479
You know that, right?
You... you ruined my childhood.

231
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,449
It was nothing, okay.
Your dad over reacted.

232
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,717
Your mom was half his age.

233
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,252
I think she just wanted
his attention.

234
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:24,624
What, am I just supposed
to agree with you?

235
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,928
Like I said,
I ain't proud of it.

236
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,663
I fucked up.

237
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,966
I lost a great partner
and a friend.

238
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,369
Do you know why my dad
came back to Hawaii?

239
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,308
Your dad hadn't talked to me
in over 10 years, man.

240
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:47,447
Word was, he was tracking
a real whale.

241
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,050
A big ass bounty.

242
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:53,054
I figured he must have died
trying to collect it.

243
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,555
You ever hear
of Terrance billford?

244
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,424
Yeah.

245
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,994
Biggest bounty on record.
Set at eight figures.

246
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,763
Here's why.

247
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,465
Took out three cops
execution style.

248
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,036
I think dad was obsessed
with him.

249
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,938
Well, he wasn't the only one.

250
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:14,741
I mean everybody in the game
knows billford's story.

251
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:18,880
He skipped bail on murder,
drug trafficking charges.

252
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:22,415
I mean, the son of a bitch
was El gringo narco,

253
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,484
biggest meth operation
in the midwest.

254
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:27,320
I mean, he killed cops,
even his own kin.

255
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,023
I mean, who allows bail on that?

256
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,724
Judge set the bail
at 10 million.

257
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,069
He didn't even think
that billford

258
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,593
or anybody else
could ever pay it.

259
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:35,662
Billford paid in cash, man.

260
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,965
Then he walks straight
out of the court.

261
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,499
Nobody sees him again.

262
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,403
I don't know...

263
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:47,008
I think dad might have
finally found him.

264
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,076
It's a small jungle, kid.

265
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,378
I mean, if there was a tiger
that big on the island,

266
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,512
I'd know about it.

267
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:53,848
Yeah, whatever happened,

268
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,852
I'm not leaving until
I find out who killed him.

269
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:01,621
- Nice game.
- Yeah, thanks.

270
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:02,900
I mean, you let me win,
and we both know it.

271
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:05,625
But I'm keeping this anyway.

272
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,562
So uh, who's helping you
organize everything?

273
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,663
Organize what?

274
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,933
Funeral... the stuff.

275
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:15,136
Right, yeah. Look um...

276
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,840
Yeah, that's me.
I guess, I uh...

277
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:22,475
There's not much left
of him to Bury.

278
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:25,079
They gave me some things
they found in his car.

279
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,014
Including this.

280
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:30,784
Lelani arms, yeah.
I know the hotel.

281
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,162
Yeah, if dad had
a lead on billford,

282
00:17:32,186 --> 00:17:35,156
I might still find
it here, right?

283
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:38,425
Look, your dad was a harder
man than both of us.

284
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,895
Whatever he was on to
got him killed.

285
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:42,596
What are the chances
I can convince you

286
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,998
to just stay out of this?

287
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,399
Look man, I didn't
come here for a tan.

288
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,136
Right.

289
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,639
Well, don't think I'm letting
you score a bounty

290
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,042
like billford
right under my nose.

291
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,410
Without splitting it 50-50.

292
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,751
You wanna get to work or not?

293
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,855
Let's do it.

294
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:09,522
Let's do it.

295
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,484
Mr. Buckley.

296
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:40,587
Oh, hello. How are you?

297
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,723
Wonderful to see you.
What a fabulous affair!

298
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:47,761
Now, my husband is telling me
that your plans for Maui

299
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,964
will make it a new
international business hub.

300
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:53,000
Well, I know your husband.
He's a very wise man.

301
00:18:53,034 --> 00:18:55,202
And that's not
just because he chose you.

302
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:57,771
Oh, thank you.

303
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:01,909
Now, you love Hawaii,
I love Hawaii.

304
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,510
We all love Hawaii.

305
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:06,613
But, being said,
we have to diversify.

306
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,615
We have to expand.

307
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,119
And, with due respect,
these grandfather laws,

308
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:15,022
I mean really, it's like
every third banyan tree

309
00:19:15,056 --> 00:19:16,857
is a sacred tribe.

310
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:20,194
We know. It's like the word
"profit" is a dirty word.

311
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:24,165
Exactly. And that's why,
I'm supporting Thomas Kane.

312
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,201
It should be our privilege
to expand opportunities

313
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,803
for all of Hawaii.

314
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,905
- Here, dad.
- Oh, good. Time for a toast.

315
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,206
Excuse me.

316
00:19:32,239 --> 00:19:33,673
Everyone!

317
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,078
A toast to Thomas Kane.

318
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:39,914
The next great senator
of Hawaii.

319
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:47,288
- And who is this handsome young man?
- Mm.

320
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:50,257
This is my son, ern.
And this is Mrs. Tilly.

321
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,759
- Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
- Well, it's always a pleasure

322
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,128
to meet
a well-mannered young man.

323
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:58,966
And, his mother's here tonight?

324
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,668
No, his... his mother
passed away a few years ago.

325
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,938
But we're healing, doing fine.

326
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:06,073
Well, it would be our pleasure
to have you two

327
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:07,908
for dinner one night.

328
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:10,643
You just name the evening
and I will have our chefs

329
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,080
whip up some fine
Louisiana cooking.

330
00:20:13,114 --> 00:20:14,949
That is an unexpected
invitation.

331
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:16,226
- Hmm.
- What do you think, son?

332
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,284
Yeah. Yes, I am.

333
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:18,853
Let's do then.

334
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,560
So, what's the plan?

335
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,939
There's too many eyes
at the front desk.

336
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,297
Let me give you the tour.

337
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:43,277
Yeah, it's me.

338
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,147
You know that bastard, who used
to partner with Ian Swann?

339
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,580
He just showed up.

340
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,687
- Jesus.
- Holy shit.

341
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,665
Well, whatever
they were looking for,

342
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,634
- I doubt they found it.
- Why do you say that?

343
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:11,038
Because they would've stopped
before they trashed everything.

344
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,309
Hey.

345
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:17,610
Whoever was here,
we must have just missed them.

346
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:19,612
We'll try to think like
your old man, alright?

347
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:20,957
He had evidence
on these bastards,

348
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,316
where would he hide it?

349
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,657
One of my guys spotted
Robbie Cole heading upstairs.

350
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,093
Cole?

351
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,061
That's not
a fucking coincidence, is it?

352
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,807
Is one of our men
still in the room?

353
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:47,975
Fuck no.

354
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,749
Hey, hey. Check it out.

355
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,822
Billford.

356
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:04,258
Yeah. He looks dead.

357
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,795
I can't let Cole find something
you fucking idiots missed.

358
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,701
Housekeeping.

359
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:16,070
No thanks.

360
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:19,240
Turn down your bed, sir?

361
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,108
Uh, bed's already turned down.

362
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:26,247
Hey!

363
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,747
Get down!

364
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,996
What the fuck!

365
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,432
She's gone. Stay low.

366
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:49,336
Fuck, Nikki!

367
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,005
Shit!

368
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:32,947
It's gone to shit.

369
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,114
Jam the police band.

370
00:23:34,148 --> 00:23:35,416
Copy that.

371
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:14,288
What's happening?

372
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:15,990
The guy jumped overboard.

373
00:24:16,023 --> 00:24:17,891
From the tenth floor?
Is he dead?

374
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,094
I can't tell.
He hit the goddamn pool pond.

375
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,936
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm so sorry.

376
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:31,071
There's been a disturbance
next door

377
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:34,375
and I'm told that we need
to evacuate immediately.

378
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:37,845
I apologize
but please allow Maui's best

379
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:39,513
to escort you to your cars.

380
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,181
And have a wonderful night.

381
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:45,052
Don't forget to...
To vote for Thomas Kane.

382
00:24:45,085 --> 00:24:46,487
What the fuck is happening?

383
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,493
I think he still might be
under the water.

384
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:55,562
Well, finish him. And don't stop
till the fucking body floats.

385
00:25:14,948 --> 00:25:15,983
Freeze!

386
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,327
Ryan Swann!

387
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,430
Let's go, come with me.
Somebody wants to talk to you.

388
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:54,054
Get in.

389
00:25:54,088 --> 00:25:55,923
- Where am I going?
- Nowhere.

390
00:25:55,956 --> 00:25:58,559
Now, get your ass in the car
or go back in the cell.

391
00:25:58,592 --> 00:25:59,626
Doesn't matter to me.

392
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:09,670
Coffee?

393
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:12,573
No thanks.

394
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:16,110
Oh, that's a shame.
Double Espresso.

395
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,946
Vanilla spiced, seasoned huh.

396
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,183
I'm Buckley.
Pleasure to meet you.

397
00:26:23,217 --> 00:26:25,018
Hey, you wanna tell me
what I'm doing here?

398
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:27,354
Well, it's just
a friendly conversation,

399
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:28,422
that's all.

400
00:26:30,657 --> 00:26:34,061
Do you know
why I have a double Espresso?

401
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:38,332
Because I didn't sleep
last night.

402
00:26:38,365 --> 00:26:41,969
Those fireworks in the hotel
were spectacular.

403
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:43,642
I thought it was a goddamn
fourth of July.

404
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,039
Put an early end
to a party of mine.

405
00:26:46,073 --> 00:26:47,207
I'm sorry to hear that.

406
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,009
Hm.

407
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:52,446
And I understand that
you are lucky to be alive.

408
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,316
It's funny I don't feel lucky.

409
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,620
I wouldn't either.
You lost your father.

410
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:02,289
Very sorry about that.
My sympathies.

411
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,357
Did you know him?

412
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,058
Well, I met him once only

413
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:08,328
but he did made quite
an impression on me.

414
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:13,200
Mr. Buckley?

415
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:14,511
The gentleman over there
just told me

416
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:15,969
to put his drink on your bill.

417
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,745
You know him?

418
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:27,314
I have no idea who he is.

419
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:30,284
So, why don't you go over there
and ask him who he is?

420
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:32,219
And if he doesn't have
the right answer,

421
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:34,555
make sure that
he doesn't bother us again.

422
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,296
Your man needed some fresh air.

423
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:20,434
Do you mind?

424
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:23,437
Well, let's see you have managed

425
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,606
to invite yourself to my table

426
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:27,541
and interrupt my dinner.

427
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,243
Now, who the hell are you?

428
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:32,379
My name is Swann, like the bird.

429
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:35,516
Now, why would I buy you
a drink, Mr. Swann?

430
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,419
I'm looking for a friend
of yours.

431
00:28:42,824 --> 00:28:45,292
I have no idea who this is.

432
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:47,628
And if I did,
why the hell would I tell you?

433
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:49,296
Now, if you don't mind,

434
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:52,699
I would like to go back to
my delicious wagyu steak.

435
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:56,336
You're funding a candidate
for senator.

436
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,841
If this man is anyone near you,
you need my help.

437
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:02,309
Are you saying that
this man is dangerous?

438
00:29:02,342 --> 00:29:05,512
The FBI thinks so.

439
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:09,449
What about you, Mr. Swann?
Are... are you dangerous?

440
00:29:09,483 --> 00:29:11,285
Not to my friends.

441
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:14,254
Well, that's too bad.
Because I have enough friends.

442
00:29:22,462 --> 00:29:25,232
Funny, he said
the same kind of thing.

443
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:30,604
Thanks for the drink.

444
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:37,244
You find out everything you can
about that son of a bitch.

445
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,545
You got it, boss.

446
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,556
Ah, such a tragedy, really.

447
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:54,461
Did he ever um, tell you why,
he came to Hawaii?

448
00:29:54,494 --> 00:29:58,765
No. No, we ah... we lost touch.

449
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,568
Well, that's a shame,
now that he's gone.

450
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,574
Now, what... what transpired
last night though?

451
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:10,477
I want to forget about it.

452
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,279
It's kind of hard to forget.

453
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:13,480
People died.

454
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:14,816
I mean yes, but there's...

455
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,450
There's surveillance
cameras there

456
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,820
and I'm told,
that it was self-defense.

457
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:20,822
They fired at you first.

458
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:22,522
And now you wouldn't wanna
make a mountain

459
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:23,825
out of molehill.

460
00:30:23,858 --> 00:30:25,692
I would just leave it...
Leave it alone.

461
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:29,529
You're free to go.

462
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,643
May I ask you uh,
what your plans are?

463
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:45,345
I don't know.

464
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:49,316
I'm thinking of sticking around.

465
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,519
Yeah, someone killed my dad.

466
00:30:52,552 --> 00:30:53,855
I wanna know who.

467
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:55,188
Hm, of course.

468
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:56,390
You will, you'll find out.

469
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,191
I mean, we're on it.

470
00:30:58,225 --> 00:31:00,594
This is Hawaii's best
looking after this.

471
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:02,529
Why do you care?

472
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:04,741
Well, because I believe that
there's some bad players involved

473
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:06,366
with your father's death.

474
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,435
I liked to see them
come to justice.

475
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,238
Yeah, so do I.

476
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,706
Yes.

477
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:15,242
Now, a word of advice,

478
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:18,278
I would leave this island
and not come back.

479
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,381
You've got a bright future,
but it's on the mainland,

480
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,250
not here.

481
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:24,651
If you stay till tomorrow, I...

482
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:27,688
I can't promise
I can protect you.

483
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,523
Protect me from who?

484
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:30,757
I don't know.

485
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,559
Maybe... maybe yourself.

486
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:34,261
Oh, and by the way,

487
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:36,596
there's a midnight flight,
Hawaiian airlines,

488
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,766
and I understand
that they actually serve a meal.

489
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,468
Well, who knows
they might throw in

490
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:44,337
a complimentary pineapple
or a coconut.

491
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:45,739
Something like that.

492
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:48,642
Have a good trip.

493
00:32:03,825 --> 00:32:06,259
Ryan! What's going on?

494
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,594
I heard you just got arrested.

495
00:32:07,627 --> 00:32:08,939
Well, they haven't even
charged me

496
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:10,530
thanks to some guy
named Buckley.

497
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:11,999
Oh, of course.

498
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,835
He has a lot of influence
on this island.

499
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:15,803
So, I noticed.

500
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:17,637
So, I've been taken off
your father's case.

501
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,773
Apparently being seen with you
is bad for my career.

502
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,408
None of this makes any sense.

503
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:22,652
You know,
what I'm really worried about

504
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:24,544
right now is Robbie.

505
00:32:24,578 --> 00:32:26,713
I've been looking for him.
Was he with you last night?

506
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:28,049
Yeah, last time I saw him,

507
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:29,817
he had a bag pulled
over his head.

508
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,384
Oh, my god.

509
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,821
Yeah, we have to do something.

510
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:36,456
Look, right now the police
are no help.

511
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,926
The whole case
has been put on ice.

512
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,029
But there's another way we can
find out what happened to Robbie.

513
00:32:42,063 --> 00:32:44,303
There's some friends of mine
I want you to meet. Come on.

514
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,436
Welcome to the rip tide club.

515
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:52,006
Nice place.
It's kind of above my pay grade.

516
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:54,441
Don't worry,
your money's no good here.

517
00:32:54,474 --> 00:32:55,843
This is Nikki's club.

518
00:32:55,877 --> 00:32:57,611
When I need intel
the force can't get,

519
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,613
she always comes through.

520
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,048
I'm about to show you

521
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:02,592
how we know
what's going on in this club

522
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:05,853
way before the cops do.
This way.

523
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:21,368
Gentlemen,
I need you to clear out.

524
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:23,436
Drinks on the house at the bar.

525
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,678
Ladies, ladies, gather around.

526
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:35,382
These ladies have given me
more leads than the entire mpd.

527
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,984
Sooner or later,

528
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:39,486
every bad boy on this island
winds up on this club.

529
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,888
And after a few drinks,

530
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:42,065
they just love to talk
to the girls.

531
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,690
Damn right.

532
00:33:43,723 --> 00:33:45,135
Kai may look sweet,
but don't cross her.

533
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,028
She did two tours
in Afghanistan.

534
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:49,696
Semper fi. Muah!

535
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:51,798
Oh, it's nice to meet you. Oh!

536
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:53,700
Hey, I like the vibe back here.

537
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,137
Relax, baby.

538
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,105
You look like a rabbit
in a fox den.

539
00:33:59,773 --> 00:34:01,976
We wanna get a line on Robbie.

540
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:05,112
You can trust everybody here.
They're devoted to the cause.

541
00:34:05,146 --> 00:34:06,780
What cause?

542
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:09,416
The locals, their land
and their families.

543
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:11,451
You taken him
to paradise city yet?

544
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:12,820
What's that, another club?

545
00:34:12,854 --> 00:34:14,654
It's better than any club.

546
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:17,390
It's the most beautiful place
on the island.

547
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:18,758
And we want to keep it that way.

548
00:34:18,792 --> 00:34:20,127
The only problem is Buckley.

549
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:21,661
I take it you're not a fan?

550
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:23,030
Oh, hell no!

551
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:24,798
Mining is off-limits in Hawaii.

552
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:26,700
Especially the sacred mountains.

553
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,669
There are clan elders
who control home land resources.

554
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:31,605
And Buckley,
bought off all of them.

555
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:33,174
What... what that's
gotta to do with...

556
00:34:33,207 --> 00:34:34,741
With Robbie? Or my dad?

557
00:34:34,774 --> 00:34:36,110
Maybe nothing.

558
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:38,112
Or maybe that's what
last night was all about

559
00:34:38,145 --> 00:34:41,481
and the reason why buck
is so interested in you.

560
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,084
Okay, ladies.

561
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:45,418
You've all heard about the hit
at the lelani hotel.

562
00:34:45,452 --> 00:34:47,587
I need you to go out there
tonight, work the floor.

563
00:34:47,621 --> 00:34:49,991
Find out who wants to brag on
what happened to Robbie.

564
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,491
- We got it.
- Alright. Go, girls.

565
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:52,827
- I love you, ma.
- Bye, Ryan.

566
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,962
Go. Go, girls go!

567
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:57,530
Bye, Ryan.

568
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,066
Get out there.

569
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,968
That was a nice place.

570
00:35:01,002 --> 00:35:02,502
It was only the lunch crowd.

571
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:04,437
I know, right.

572
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:10,777
I know it's only been 24 hours
since you've been locked up.

573
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:12,947
How you holding up?

574
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,750
I'm feeling kinda nuts,
to be honest, you know?

575
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:20,121
Back at the hotel, it was crazy.

576
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:21,889
Tell me about it.

577
00:35:21,923 --> 00:35:24,959
I've never killed anyone before.

578
00:35:24,992 --> 00:35:26,861
I put a guy in a wheelchair
once in Jersey,

579
00:35:26,894 --> 00:35:29,163
but never killed anybody.

580
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:31,464
I know. I pulled your file.

581
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:34,035
Non-lethal force.

582
00:35:34,068 --> 00:35:35,702
I admire that,

583
00:35:35,735 --> 00:35:37,335
as long as you don't
get yourself killed.

584
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,775
You know, Robbie's gone.

585
00:35:41,809 --> 00:35:43,677
I should be in jail,
but I'm not.

586
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,913
And as far as I can tell,
nobody else is.

587
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:48,082
Law doesn't work that way here.

588
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:49,616
Buck will spin it.

589
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,185
Yeah, well he already has.

590
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:53,054
Local news just claimed
that a gas main blew

591
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,488
at the lelani,
nothing about a shootout.

592
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:56,623
Can you believe it?

593
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,092
He's that deep into this town?

594
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:01,262
Yes, and worse,
word is one of the elders

595
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:04,731
was a hold out
on buck's mining scheme.

596
00:36:04,764 --> 00:36:06,566
One day he just disappeared.

597
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,870
There's no body,
so no investigation.

598
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:11,272
But there were rumors...

599
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,942
That the elder was still alive

600
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,978
when they dumped him
into haleakala.

601
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,883
You think that's
what happened to Robbie?

602
00:36:22,917 --> 00:36:25,186
Ah, no.
Don't you count Robbie out.

603
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:27,587
He can take care of himself.

604
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,125
Okay still, we can't just
here and wait for a lead.

605
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:32,625
What do you have in mind?

606
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:34,095
I, uh...

607
00:36:37,131 --> 00:36:40,167
Can you... can you take me
to the crime scene?

608
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,969
Where they shot my father down.

609
00:36:42,003 --> 00:36:44,637
There's not much to see,
the waves have them washed away.

610
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:50,044
But yeah, what are you doing
tomorrow morning?

611
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:51,578
Free as a bird.

612
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:52,980
Great.

613
00:36:53,014 --> 00:36:55,582
Yeah. I'll see you.

614
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:35,122
It happened in this cove.

615
00:37:35,156 --> 00:37:38,092
There were shell cases
everywhere.

616
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:41,628
And your dad's rental car
was up there.

617
00:37:41,661 --> 00:37:43,064
It was shot to pieces.

618
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:44,664
He must have put up
a good fight.

619
00:37:44,697 --> 00:37:46,133
Yeah, he always did.

620
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,241
You okay?

621
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:55,843
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

622
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,777
Just ah, just give me
a moment, yeah?

623
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:06,921
What's that?

624
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,023
It's a very sophisticated
piece of equipment.

625
00:38:12,126 --> 00:38:13,626
That's a beach ball.

626
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,331
It's about to become a part

627
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,934
of an underwater metal detector.

628
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,701
$19.99 on Amazon.

629
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:22,870
It's... it's brilliant.

630
00:38:22,903 --> 00:38:25,873
- It really is.
- Yes, it is.

631
00:38:25,906 --> 00:38:29,043
The dive team combed
this entire cove.

632
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:31,278
But you know what,
I think it's worth a try.

633
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,355
<i>Little Swann,</i>

634
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:43,157
<i>we haven't talked much
in a while.</i>

635
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:45,426
<i>Just wanted to give you
some advice.</i>

636
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:48,329
<i>You wanna be in this
fucked up business?</i>

637
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,838
Drop the gun! Now!

638
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,743
<i>Yep, you're a good kid.</i>

639
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:06,313
<i>Yeah, I love you, son.
I gotta go.</i>

640
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:16,789
Hey, what do you got?

641
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:18,192
I'm not sure.

642
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:57,965
Sleep is so important.

643
00:39:57,998 --> 00:40:02,236
And it's something that
I did not get any up last night.

644
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,240
How did you sleep?

645
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:12,813
Ain't that California king
something?

646
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:15,282
I think it's the uh,
the memory foam.

647
00:40:15,316 --> 00:40:18,185
Ain't nothing like in the world.

648
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:20,821
The bed was fine.

649
00:40:20,854 --> 00:40:23,357
But the doors and the windows
were bolted shut.

650
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,159
That's a precaution.

651
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:28,128
Now, old buddy, old pal,

652
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:31,899
did you attack my people
at a hotel last night?

653
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:34,268
Did you kill Ian Swann?

654
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:35,469
I... I don't know.

655
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:37,471
What... what is an Ian Swann?

656
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:39,206
What about his son?

657
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:46,413
I think that my guys
dropped you on your head

658
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:48,781
when they were bringing
you here.

659
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:52,219
The kid you were with last night
was picked up by the cops.

660
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:56,123
But because they're friends
of mine, I let him go.

661
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:59,226
Why make enemies
when you could make friends?

662
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,396
But you... you're here
as a professional favor.

663
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:06,233
Oh, so you did me a favor
by kidnapping me?

664
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:08,469
Kidnapping! Sir...

665
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:10,337
That's what this is.

666
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,810
Oh, great.

667
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:17,978
Voila.

668
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:21,448
You are free to go as you wish.

669
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:26,186
Word is you got a lot riding
on this Kane getting elected.

670
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,888
Why didn't you run yourself?

671
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:29,490
What's the number one rule
of Hawaii?

672
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,025
Everyone's family.

673
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:33,327
Everyone is family
except for us.

674
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,297
We've been here for years
and you know what, the locals,

675
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,931
still think of us as...

676
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:40,401
As tourists, as colonizers.

677
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:43,871
I can raise a fucking
mountain from the sea,

678
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:47,174
name it after myself
and still...

679
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:48,542
You'd still be a tourist.

680
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:49,943
Still.

681
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:53,414
But there is a...

682
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:55,382
There is hope for these people.

683
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:58,085
A lot of untapped resources.

684
00:41:58,118 --> 00:42:00,020
Yeah, and you'll get
quite a slice I'm sure

685
00:42:00,054 --> 00:42:01,455
if he gets elected, right?

686
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:05,926
What's good for me,
is good for Hawaii.

687
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:07,294
You must be hungry.

688
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:08,462
Are you hungry?

689
00:42:08,495 --> 00:42:10,097
Please.

690
00:42:11,165 --> 00:42:12,466
Well, here.

691
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:17,438
Suit yourself.

692
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,374
You know,
my guys did some extensive

693
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:23,010
background research on you.

694
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,979
And you know what,
it was a page Turner.

695
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:28,115
I... I couldn't put it down.

696
00:42:28,148 --> 00:42:31,018
Well, don't believe
everything you read.

697
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:35,055
Mm-hm. Chicago, what about
Chicago? You left the force.

698
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,623
A great pension. Why?

699
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:38,492
Why would you do
something like that?

700
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:41,228
I didn't love bein' a cop.

701
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:44,932
But bounty hunting,
it's a whole different animal.

702
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:47,134
There's no rules, no superiors.

703
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:50,037
And I can learn a lot
about the scum I'm chasing.

704
00:42:51,705 --> 00:42:53,107
You know,

705
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:57,578
there's a story
going around about you.

706
00:42:57,611 --> 00:43:01,048
Oh good. I love a good story.

707
00:43:01,081 --> 00:43:03,050
Especially if it's about me.

708
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:09,123
You're no billionaire,
although you'd like to be.

709
00:43:09,156 --> 00:43:11,592
And this whole act of yours
is being bankrolled

710
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:15,162
by Terrance billford
and his cartel buddies.

711
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:16,597
That's what I hear.

712
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:23,237
Ern, go upstairs and fire up
your video game.

713
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,471
I'll be right up.

714
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:29,176
Now, that is a good story.
Now, who is this?

715
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:31,178
Who is this blifferd...
Billford...

716
00:43:31,211 --> 00:43:32,613
Who is this?

717
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:35,182
Well, real piece of shit,
slung meth.

718
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:38,218
Big time operator back in the day though.
Made a fortune.

719
00:43:38,252 --> 00:43:41,221
Well, I'm sure he didn't
force people to take drugs.

720
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:43,590
If they did, it was on them.

721
00:43:45,292 --> 00:43:47,394
You're right to be scared.

722
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:50,464
Cause it wouldn't take much for
me to blow the whistle on you.

723
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:52,533
You know, see if you're running
this campaign

724
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:54,201
with laundered drug money...

725
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:56,670
The only thing
that I'm scared of is me.

726
00:43:56,703 --> 00:44:00,240
And I am me, so...

727
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,209
There's nothing to be scared of.

728
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,411
But what about you, Robbie?

729
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:07,381
Maybe it's time that you tell me

730
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,383
where you heard this good story

731
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:12,486
and who else knows about it.

732
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,421
And why the fuck
would I do that?

733
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:28,735
Any luck?

734
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,537
The FBI gave us this tech.

735
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:32,773
It's supposed to help
reconfigure damaged data.

736
00:44:32,807 --> 00:44:34,775
What about water damage?

737
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,677
We're about to find out.

738
00:44:43,283 --> 00:44:44,551
Here we go.

739
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:46,620
Hey, let me see.

740
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:48,322
They're on the beach.

741
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:49,723
Do you recognize him?

742
00:44:49,756 --> 00:44:52,192
I can't see his face.

743
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:56,663
Dad's body is bleeding heavy,
drawin' in the sharks.

744
00:44:58,833 --> 00:45:02,169
Fuck. He never had a chance.

745
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:03,570
That's just weird.

746
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:05,405
What's weird?

747
00:45:05,439 --> 00:45:08,509
That beach hasn't seen
a single shark attack ever.

748
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,386
There's no access.
They get hung up on the coral.

749
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:14,515
He's dead. I saw the body,
the blood tests.

750
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:16,392
I think there are people
who might be able to help us.

751
00:45:16,416 --> 00:45:18,318
They watch over this part
of the island.

752
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:20,287
A watch over?

753
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,222
They still honor the old ways.

754
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:23,624
Well, where do they live?

755
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:26,393
This place buck calls
paradise city.

756
00:45:27,862 --> 00:45:31,665
Look, I'll take you there
if you promise

757
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:33,367
you'll behave yourself.

758
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,068
Behave myself?

759
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,404
Uh, they're pretty touchy
about strangers.

760
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,114
Yeah?

761
00:45:47,147 --> 00:45:49,383
I just saw that guy
you asked about...

762
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,118
Swann.

763
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:52,686
Where did he go?

764
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:54,497
I don't know, but he's headed
to paradise city.

765
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:56,123
Right, I got it.

766
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,265
It's just beyond
these mountains.

767
00:46:05,299 --> 00:46:07,100
I thought you said
this was a shortcut?

768
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:08,468
It is to me.

769
00:46:08,502 --> 00:46:10,337
Come on, it's worth it,
I promise.

770
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:41,702
Oh, you're gonna walk
through there barefoot?

771
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:45,372
Yup. You ought
to try it sometimes.

772
00:46:45,405 --> 00:46:46,773
Connects you to the earth.

773
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:49,176
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty
connected to my boots.

774
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,677
Fine, suit yourself.

775
00:46:55,515 --> 00:46:58,485
When I was a little girl,
we never wore shoes here.

776
00:46:58,518 --> 00:47:00,855
This is considered sacred land.

777
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:02,656
You grew up here?

778
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:06,360
Yup. My mom and her sister
raised me here when I was a kid.

779
00:47:06,393 --> 00:47:07,929
I never knew who my dad was.

780
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:11,698
But that didn't matter,
'cause this place, the people...

781
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,734
It's all the family
I ever needed.

782
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,474
Are we almost there?

783
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:21,675
Just few more minutes.

784
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:22,944
Okay, well just give me a sec

785
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,211
to return some of my sacred

786
00:47:24,244 --> 00:47:26,413
water back to the earth.

787
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:28,749
Oh, shit.

788
00:47:53,875 --> 00:47:56,410
Holy shit!

789
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:59,847
Whoa! Hey, hey guys...
Sorry, I was just ah...

790
00:47:59,881 --> 00:48:02,749
Shut your mouth, haole!
What you doing here?

791
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:05,619
He's with me! He's with me.

792
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:06,620
Savannah!

793
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:07,822
Yeah.

794
00:48:07,855 --> 00:48:11,725
Hey! Auntie, look who's here.

795
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:14,394
Savannah!

796
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:17,631
My little girl,
so glad to see you.

797
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:21,268
But why you bring this
smooth talking haole over here?

798
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:24,538
I came to this island to find
out who killed my father.

799
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,506
His name's Ian Swann.

800
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,809
Is that true?

801
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:31,712
You're a friend or foe?

802
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:34,314
I was a fighter but yeah,
I'm feeling really peaceful

803
00:48:34,347 --> 00:48:35,515
looking at that Remington.

804
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:36,918
Do you think you
could just ah...

805
00:48:36,951 --> 00:48:38,552
Yeah, that's nice. Thanks.

806
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:41,254
We can always use
another fighter.

807
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:43,557
But you don't try fighting
with me, okay,

808
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,893
because you no can't win.

809
00:48:48,328 --> 00:48:49,730
Ah-huh-huh.

810
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:56,603
Who's hungry? Let's eat.

811
00:48:56,636 --> 00:48:59,040
After you.

812
00:48:59,073 --> 00:49:00,474
No, okay. That's fine.

813
00:49:00,507 --> 00:49:01,976
Come on.

814
00:49:30,805 --> 00:49:34,075
Welcome to paliuli village.

815
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:35,910
Locals call it paradise city.

816
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:37,511
Lives up to the name,
don't you think?

817
00:49:37,544 --> 00:49:38,745
Yeah, I can see that.

818
00:49:44,886 --> 00:49:48,722
They're the only homestead that
refused to be bribed by buck.

819
00:49:48,755 --> 00:49:50,390
They're the resistance.

820
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:09,709
What's he saying?

821
00:50:09,743 --> 00:50:12,412
He said he wants you to prove
that you're Ian Swann's son.

822
00:50:12,445 --> 00:50:13,780
Yeah, sure.

823
00:50:13,815 --> 00:50:16,483
Oh, no. Not that kind of proof.

824
00:50:16,516 --> 00:50:18,451
Charlie's an old school kahuna.

825
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:20,453
One of the last in the islands.

826
00:50:20,487 --> 00:50:21,655
So, what does he want?

827
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:28,795
He'd like you to sit
with him for a while.

828
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,898
Cause he has a way
of knowing your truth.

829
00:50:35,635 --> 00:50:36,904
Just the boy.

830
00:50:36,938 --> 00:50:38,638
We can save him a plate.

831
00:51:23,117 --> 00:51:24,919
Do I get to ask
what's in this first?

832
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,386
No.

833
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:39,901
Ah, something tells me
these aren't portobello.

834
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,072
Cheers.

835
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:21,175
Hey, we got to restock
the whiskey.

836
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:37,858
Robbie?

837
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:41,228
Robbie!

838
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:55,977
It's been nice.
I think I'll be going.

839
00:53:00,281 --> 00:53:02,950
Thanks for sharing
your stash and I uh...

840
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:05,052
And I hope I passed the test.

841
00:53:05,086 --> 00:53:06,553
- No.
- Yeah.

842
00:53:06,586 --> 00:53:09,622
Be still!
Think of your father.

843
00:53:09,656 --> 00:53:13,861
What did he teach you,
to help you become a man.

844
00:53:13,894 --> 00:53:15,129
Not much.

845
00:53:15,162 --> 00:53:16,629
Think of something.

846
00:53:18,665 --> 00:53:20,533
I uh...

847
00:53:24,738 --> 00:53:26,673
He taught me
how to handle a gun.

848
00:53:28,742 --> 00:53:30,577
And after he left home,

849
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,855
I swore
I'd never touch one again.

850
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,914
I had to do things my way.

851
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,853
Hey, what more proof
do you need, man?

852
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:41,255
I can't just sit here.

853
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:43,290
No more words.

854
00:53:43,324 --> 00:53:46,327
Picture him in your mind,

855
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,529
then we'll both know
whose son you are.

856
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:05,012
Go ahead, Ryan.
First, the barrel.

857
00:54:06,814 --> 00:54:09,150
Not that hard, go easy.

858
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:14,587
I'm not like you!
I don't need to use a gun.

859
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:16,290
It might save your life one day.

860
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:18,926
I'm never gonna kill
anyone, ever!

861
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:20,693
Ryan, pick it up.

862
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:22,762
Ryan! Ryan!

863
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:27,268
He is your son.
It's safe to show your face now.

864
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:29,170
What the hell, Charlie?

865
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:30,938
I could have told you
that myself.

866
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:33,274
It's not just your life at risk
if you're found here.

867
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,707
It's the whole settlement.

868
00:54:34,741 --> 00:54:36,210
How strong is this dope?

869
00:54:36,243 --> 00:54:38,379
Because I... um...

870
00:54:38,412 --> 00:54:42,183
It's me, Ryan.

871
00:54:42,216 --> 00:54:44,852
I wouldn't blame you
if you'd rather see me dead.

872
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:46,053
You're alive?

873
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:47,354
Yeah.

874
00:54:47,388 --> 00:54:52,159
Took a couple of bullets
but I'm fine.

875
00:54:52,193 --> 00:54:53,726
You listened to my message.

876
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,829
That's a first.

877
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,030
Is that all you can say?

878
00:54:56,063 --> 00:54:57,865
I... I thought you were dead.

879
00:54:57,898 --> 00:54:59,934
I dropped everything.
People tried to kill me.

880
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:02,635
Easy, kid. Come here.

881
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:08,708
I'm sorry, Ryan.

882
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:18,119
Charlie,
what the hell did you do?

883
00:55:18,152 --> 00:55:20,421
Old style lie detector.

884
00:55:20,454 --> 00:55:23,257
Shit.
Better brew up some coffee.

885
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,925
Make it strong.

886
00:55:28,863 --> 00:55:30,397
Your father first came to us

887
00:55:30,431 --> 00:55:32,867
to learn about
that evil man, buck.

888
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,036
So, the enemy of my enemy is my friend?
That kind of thing.

889
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:40,808
More than that. If Mr. Buck
wins, all of Hawaii loses.

890
00:55:40,841 --> 00:55:43,776
We helped Ian that day,
because he was helping us.

891
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:45,412
They saved my life.

892
00:55:45,446 --> 00:55:48,048
Oh. Not just us.

893
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:52,153
It was the island herself
that wanted you to win.

894
00:55:57,124 --> 00:56:00,961
The tide dragged him under,
away from his enemies.

895
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:04,398
And we saw him
and pulled him ashore in time.

896
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:09,303
But what about that body
they showed me at the morgue?

897
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:13,107
It was a drowning victim,
borrowed from the morgue.

898
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,409
- Sorry.
- Yeah, but why?

899
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:17,244
I needed buck to think
I was dead

900
00:56:17,278 --> 00:56:19,346
at least 'till I got back
on my feet.

901
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,348
You said you had evidence
on Terrance.

902
00:56:21,382 --> 00:56:23,184
I did.

903
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:25,386
And his trail led me to buck.

904
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:27,154
I had all the proof I needed.

905
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:29,190
Yeah, whatever you had,
your intel is long gone.

906
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:31,091
I figured that.

907
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,060
I had a backup on my cell phone.

908
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:36,063
That's somewhere
under Honolulu bay.

909
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:38,165
Well, maybe not.

910
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,736
That's a hell of a trick.

911
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:48,375
Now, let me show you a trick
Terrance played on all of us.

912
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:51,278
I got these from a surgeon
who lost his license,

913
00:56:51,312 --> 00:56:53,047
working for the cartel.

914
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:59,853
Holy shit!
So, Terrance is buck!

915
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:02,122
The devil may change his face,

916
00:57:02,156 --> 00:57:04,358
but the spirit of evil
is the same.

917
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:06,360
So, that day at the cove?

918
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:13,500
I had buck in custody
and proof that he was Terrance.

919
00:57:13,534 --> 00:57:15,802
And it all went off the rails.

920
00:57:29,216 --> 00:57:31,819
So, what we're dealing with
is more than just a land grab

921
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,454
by some dirty politicians?

922
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:35,990
I mean,
buck is a stone-cold killer.

923
00:57:36,023 --> 00:57:37,790
He's tied to the cartels.

924
00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:40,227
He'll strip mine the land
and make Maui

925
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:42,963
the international drug port.

926
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:45,065
That's what they dream of.

927
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:48,502
Oh, wait. It's Nikki. Hey.

928
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:51,805
<i>Robbie...</i>

929
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,008
What? Okay, okay.

930
00:57:54,041 --> 00:57:55,843
Look, whatever we do,
we better do it fast.

931
00:57:55,876 --> 00:57:57,578
Robbie's being held
at the golden throne.

932
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:59,146
What's the golden throne?

933
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:00,447
Buck's own little kingdom

934
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:02,082
isolated on the far side
of the island.

935
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:03,884
Well, we've gotta get
Robbie out.

936
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:06,086
It's not that easy.
He built it like a fortress.

937
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,988
That's good.
They'll never see us comin'.

938
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:11,158
There is no us.
I do this on my own.

939
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:13,303
Yeah, isn't that how you
started this mess on your own?

940
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:14,528
Look, like it or not, dad,

941
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:16,096
I'm pretty fucking good
on my job.

942
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:17,865
That's not the point.

943
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:20,167
Yeah, maybe this is.
I am going to golden throne.

944
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,468
I'm getting Robbie out

945
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,037
and you can either come
and help me,

946
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:24,872
or you can stay here eating poi.

947
00:58:24,905 --> 00:58:26,583
Hey, we all need to calm down
try to work together.

948
00:58:26,607 --> 00:58:29,376
Or Robbie's gonna end up dead
if he's not dead already, okay?

949
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,011
You're right.

950
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:32,422
She's smarter
than your last girlfriend.

951
00:58:32,446 --> 00:58:34,315
She's not my girlfriend.

952
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:36,216
Not with that attitude.

953
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:41,488
We're loading up the truck
to get you guys back in to town.

954
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:44,024
May your journey be a safe one.

955
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:45,192
Thank you.

956
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,995
Come on.

957
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:53,233
I love you, auntie.

958
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:04,378
Thank you, auntie.

959
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:17,424
I'm so worried for them.

960
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:21,462
Maybe they have a chance, maybe.

961
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:23,931
I'm sending them
a blessing of protection.

962
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:33,273
Auntie, let's go!

963
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:35,175
We must get the kids
to the school house.

964
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:50,057
I know who you are!

965
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:53,127
Just a coward with a bullet.

966
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,528
That bullet for me?

967
00:59:58,365 --> 00:59:59,500
Burn this place down.

968
01:00:24,491 --> 01:00:27,227
Hey, check it out.

969
01:00:27,261 --> 01:00:29,229
The shit just got deeper.

970
01:00:29,263 --> 01:00:31,965
<i>Hawaii has suffered
yet another tragedy.</i>

971
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:34,735
<i>The ninth reservation,
sacred home land territory,</i>

972
01:00:34,768 --> 01:00:38,539
<i>has been claimed by a fire
from faulty gas storage tanks.</i>

973
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:40,174
No!

974
01:00:41,575 --> 01:00:43,577
<i>Part of the territory.</i>

975
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,379
<i>Six lives have been lost</i>

976
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:47,347
<i>with at least
two dozen reported injured.</i>

977
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:49,216
To the ninth.

978
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:51,518
<i>A hui hou kakou.</i>

979
01:00:51,552 --> 01:00:53,454
Until we meet again.

980
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:56,056
<i>Hui hou kakou.</i>

981
01:00:56,089 --> 01:00:58,559
Gas tank fire!
This is bullshit!

982
01:00:58,592 --> 01:01:00,194
We have no way to prove that.

983
01:01:00,227 --> 01:01:01,595
We don't have to prove it.

984
01:01:01,628 --> 01:01:03,397
You gotta Jack it
on Terrance billford

985
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,432
and proof he's buck.
That's all the proof we need.

986
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:10,137
No. Not after a hit like that,
they'll be ready for anything.

987
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,672
I know a guy
who can get both of you

988
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:13,640
to a safe place in Bali.

989
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:15,709
Yeah, we wish you could get
rid of us that easy.

990
01:01:15,742 --> 01:01:17,478
Let's think about this.

991
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:20,280
Buck will be busy
throwing a big victory party

992
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:21,715
tomorrow for his donors.

993
01:01:21,748 --> 01:01:23,317
There's too many eyes on there.

994
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,018
No, no, no, no.
She's onto something.

995
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:27,688
Maybe we can uh,
we can trojan horse our way in.

996
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:29,423
It would be the last night
he expects.

997
01:01:29,456 --> 01:01:32,059
You get buck,
we get Robbie out alive.

998
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:35,329
Your call, kid.

999
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:39,032
You still in?

1000
01:01:52,346 --> 01:01:53,714
Are you ready for this?

1001
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:55,349
If Robbie's in there,
we'll find him.

1002
01:01:55,382 --> 01:01:58,585
You got 30 minutes.
After that, get out.

1003
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:00,354
It'll get ugly
when I take buck down

1004
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:01,488
when we take him down.

1005
01:02:01,522 --> 01:02:03,156
Just get Robbie out safe.

1006
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,558
I'll take care of the rest.

1007
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:09,162
Hey, don't mind him.

1008
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:10,497
He still think he's in charge.

1009
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,215

Check for any sign of Robbie,
okay?

1015
01:02:52,306 --> 01:02:53,540
Bye.

1016
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,379
Drivers wait in the back.

1017
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:01,773
Well, I'm their security. They
don't go anywhere without me.

1018
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,594
You know, I'm pretty sure
your boss will be pissed

1019
01:03:04,618 --> 01:03:06,153
if the girls leave.

1020
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:09,156
Stay right here.

1021
01:03:09,189 --> 01:03:10,457
Yeah.

Oh, we should definitely.
He's going live. Take a look.

1024
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,792
<i>I wanna thank the great people

01:03:58,973 --> 01:04:01,341
You got your boy in office,
Terrance.

1031
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,210
You sure he's gonna play ball?

1032
01:04:03,243 --> 01:04:06,279
He has no choice.
Don't ever call me Terrance.

1033
01:04:06,313 --> 01:04:08,448
He's dead, he's gone.

1034
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:10,217
I'll call you whatever you like.

1035
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,728
As long as can move
the type of volume

1036
01:04:11,752 --> 01:04:13,453
you're talking about.

1037
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:15,355
As a matter of fact,

1038
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:18,592
I feel a little placed out
here myself you know, post op.

1039
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,560
Well, if you're serious
about that,

1040
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:23,330
you have to acquire a piece
of property that you...

1041
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,198
You might be interested in.

1042
01:04:25,232 --> 01:04:26,733
Everybody, raise your glasses.

1043
01:04:26,767 --> 01:04:28,669
A toast to senator Kane.

1044
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,203
And the new Maui,

1045
01:04:30,237 --> 01:04:33,373
which I have officially
renamed "heaven",

1046
01:04:33,407 --> 01:04:37,244
because from now on
everybody's wishes come true.

1047
01:04:37,277 --> 01:04:39,446
Cheers!

1048
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:43,818
Don't you ever doubt me,
mother fucker.

1049
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,759
Thanks.

1050
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:59,466
Hello, car door boy.

1051
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:00,811
My ears are still ringing
from that time you

1052
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:02,402
smack me in the head...

1053
01:05:02,436 --> 01:05:03,881
Yeah, as I recall,
you ran into my car,

1054
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:05,439
not vice versa.

1055
01:05:05,472 --> 01:05:06,707
Yeah.

1056
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,975
Nice get-up.

1057
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:13,613
You think this shit
will fool anybody?

1058
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:15,549
Your about to get your ass
killed in here.

1059
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:17,819
Now, I thought
they had you locked up.

1060
01:05:17,852 --> 01:05:19,753
Guess they let
all the animals out, huh?

1061
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:22,789
Buck pulled some strings,
charges were dropped.

1062
01:05:22,824 --> 01:05:25,993
Buck holds more power over
these islands than anyone.

1063
01:05:26,027 --> 01:05:27,895
And with the fall
of paradise city,

1064
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:29,763
there's no one left
to keep him in check.

1065
01:05:29,796 --> 01:05:31,631
Am I right?

1066
01:05:31,665 --> 01:05:36,003
Some of the best people
on this island... motherfuckers!

1067
01:05:36,037 --> 01:05:38,271
You don't seem too happy
about your boss's success.

1068
01:05:38,305 --> 01:05:39,706
He's not my boss!

1069
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:45,012
I had family in paliuli, okay?

1070
01:05:45,046 --> 01:05:47,481
He's sure as fuck not my boss.

1071
01:05:47,514 --> 01:05:50,751
You know it was no accident.

1072
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:54,021
Buck's try to run them
off their homestead.

1073
01:05:54,055 --> 01:05:56,858
If you're here
to give buck a headache,

1074
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,692
I wouldn't say no
to your helping out.

1075
01:05:58,725 --> 01:06:00,727
And I wouldn't say no
to your help.

1076
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:08,335
They're holding Robbie Cole
somewhere on this property.

1077
01:06:08,368 --> 01:06:09,736
If Robbie's alive,

1078
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,705
he'll be somewhere
in the underground.

1079
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:13,750
The word is buck built tunnels
underneath the property.

1080
01:06:13,774 --> 01:06:15,442
Do you know where?

1081
01:06:15,475 --> 01:06:17,879
I can take a look around.

1082
01:06:17,912 --> 01:06:20,047
I'll get caught
if I'm seen with you.

1083
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:25,352
Give me a few minutes,
I'll meet you back here.

1084
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:28,115
Hey, this is a private party.

1085
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,086
What the hell...

1086
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:35,156
Swann's kid.

1087
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:57,144
Die, haole...

1088
01:08:18,165 --> 01:08:20,101
Come on! Let's go, Savannah.

1089
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,973
Come on, come on!

1090
01:08:30,912 --> 01:08:32,445
Come on...

1091
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,586
My god, you think he'll drown?

1092
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:42,156
If we're lucky. Come on.

1093
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:44,629
I thought you guys were playing
on the down low. Not brawling.

1094
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:46,626
Your pal manu didn't give me
much of a choice.

1095
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,962
This way, you guys, come on.

1096
01:08:51,731 --> 01:08:53,566
Guys, they know who we are now.

1097
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,078
I have to warn Nikki and
the others they are in danger.

1098
01:08:55,102 --> 01:08:56,736
Meet us on the north end
of the property.

1099
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,772
Koa and I will take
a last look for Robbie.

1100
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:01,075
- Be careful, alright?
- Okay.

1101
01:09:01,108 --> 01:09:03,643
This door leads to a part of the
property they keep off-limits.

1102
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:04,855
I've seen zyatt go
from this door

1103
01:09:04,879 --> 01:09:06,199
and literally disappear
for hours.

1104
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:11,052
Okay. Hey, hey,
let's try this the easy way.

1105
01:09:13,988 --> 01:09:15,488
Move, haole!

1106
01:09:23,663 --> 01:09:24,932
Hold it!

1107
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,709
What are you waiting for,
Christmas?

1108
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:37,510
How did you get down here?

1109
01:09:37,544 --> 01:09:39,080
Tunnels under the house.

1110
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:41,916
Cowards always leave a way out.

1111
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:43,717
You make a friend?

1112
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:45,853
I'm a friend
of this island, sir.

1113
01:09:45,886 --> 01:09:47,121
I've heard you were too.

1114
01:09:47,154 --> 01:09:50,557
Good for you. Let's move.

1115
01:10:01,568 --> 01:10:03,904
Keep moving. Look at your six.

1116
01:10:22,356 --> 01:10:24,591
Oh, shit.

1117
01:10:31,032 --> 01:10:32,732
We're too late.

1118
01:10:36,803 --> 01:10:38,939
If you'd shown up
a few hours ago,

1119
01:10:38,973 --> 01:10:40,250
you could have watched him
jump start me

1120
01:10:40,274 --> 01:10:42,977
with that fucking car battery.

1121
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,245
You wanna give me a hand here?

1122
01:10:44,278 --> 01:10:45,980
Oh, I got it, Robbie.

1123
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:57,058
Koa, what are you doing here?

1124
01:10:57,091 --> 01:10:58,926
He's a mutual friend.

1125
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:02,830
Ian!

1126
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:05,199
Jesus, you're still alive.

1127
01:11:05,232 --> 01:11:07,868
You too.
Like an old cockroach.

1128
01:11:07,902 --> 01:11:09,736
Can you still walk?

1129
01:11:09,769 --> 01:11:12,672
I should be asking you
that question, old man.

1130
01:11:12,705 --> 01:11:14,607
I swore the next time I saw you,

1131
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:16,743
I'd punch you
in the fucking face.

1132
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:18,946
Wait, how did you manage
to stay alive down here?

1133
01:11:18,979 --> 01:11:22,615
Told buck I had proof,
billford was funding him.

1134
01:11:22,649 --> 01:11:24,018
Took a wild guess.

1135
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:25,886
You're wrong just like usual.

1136
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,088
Buck is billford.

1137
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:28,255
What the fuck?

1138
01:11:28,289 --> 01:11:29,857
You're always bullshitting me.

1139
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:32,659
Shut up, Robbie.
Or I'll tie you back up.

1140
01:11:32,692 --> 01:11:35,262
Will you guys please shut up?

1141
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:36,964
Now, dad I get it.

1142
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:38,375
That he hooked up with mom
on Thanksgiving.

1143
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,367
Get over it.

1144
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:43,736
And you, apologize.

1145
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,638
I have apologized.

1146
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:50,845
Ian, I'm sorry man.

1147
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:53,247
I'm fucking sorry, okay?

1148
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,747
I want that in writing.

1149
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:57,650
I... I can't take this.

1150
01:11:57,684 --> 01:11:59,652
Let's get the fuck outta here!

1151
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,230
Do you even know
where you're going?

1152
01:12:09,263 --> 01:12:10,697
Keep moving.

1153
01:12:13,234 --> 01:12:15,136
<i>Shots been reported
in the basement.</i>

1154
01:12:35,055 --> 01:12:36,723
Robbie Cole escaped.

1155
01:12:36,756 --> 01:12:38,826
Make sure he's dead
before he leaves this property.

1156
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:41,095
You heard him, boys.
Hunt to kill.

1157
01:12:41,128 --> 01:12:43,364
Get the boat.
I'll get my son.

1158
01:12:43,397 --> 01:12:44,941
What the hell is going
on here, Terrance?

1159
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:46,433
Calm down.
It's being taken care of.

1160
01:12:46,467 --> 01:12:48,169
I thought
you had this gangland bullshit

1161
01:12:48,202 --> 01:12:50,271
under control, Terrance!

1162
01:12:57,978 --> 01:13:01,215
Come on! This way!
This way, this way.

1163
01:13:01,248 --> 01:13:05,019
Come on. Come on.
Stay low. Stay low. Come on.

1164
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:07,288
Go, go, go!

1165
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:18,465
Hey, man,
I'm just looking for valet.

1166
01:13:18,499 --> 01:13:21,068
Don't shoot the guests.
Come on! Let's go. Come on.

1167
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:39,253
You alright?

1168
01:13:43,857 --> 01:13:45,926
Alright, you guys go first.

1169
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,128
We're gonna lay down
some cover fire. Okay?

1170
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:49,897
- Move fast, stay low.
- Alright.

1171
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,132
Alright. One, two... now!

1172
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:04,044
Better reload.

1173
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:05,813
Okay. I get the two on the left.

1174
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:07,548
I got the two on the right.

1175
01:14:07,581 --> 01:14:08,916
What about the guy
in the middle?

1176
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:11,151
Dealer's choice.

1177
01:14:11,185 --> 01:14:12,386
Now!

1178
01:14:18,993 --> 01:14:20,027
Come on!

1179
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:32,439
Zyatt Dean!

1180
01:14:32,473 --> 01:14:34,875
Hands where I can see them.

1181
01:14:34,908 --> 01:14:37,144
On your knees now!

1182
01:14:37,177 --> 01:14:39,480
Make a move
and I won't hesitate.

1183
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:41,882
I got 20 armed men out there.

1184
01:14:41,915 --> 01:14:43,284
What do you think
you're gonna do?

1185
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:44,561
Arrest me and walk
out of here alive?

1186
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:46,453
Who said anything about
arresting you?

1187
01:14:46,487 --> 01:14:49,323
If I shoot you,
it's self-defense.

1188
01:14:49,356 --> 01:14:51,892
And the world
becomes a better place.

1189
01:14:51,925 --> 01:14:54,328
Now, drop the bag
and keep your hands

1190
01:14:54,361 --> 01:14:55,963
where I can see them.

1191
01:15:01,935 --> 01:15:04,004
That wasn't so tough, was it?

1192
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:10,477
Don't try it! No!

1193
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:29,863
Where's the boat?

1194
01:15:29,897 --> 01:15:31,897
Boat's coming. Just off
that point in five minutes.

1195
01:15:33,967 --> 01:15:36,370
Hey, game's over!
Drop your weapons.

1196
01:15:36,403 --> 01:15:39,606
Go, go, go, go, go!

1197
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,378
Koa!

1198
01:16:01,028 --> 01:16:02,229
Where are we going, dad?

1199
01:16:02,262 --> 01:16:04,565
Well son, someplace new.

1200
01:16:04,598 --> 01:16:07,067
You think of it...
Think of it as an adventure.

1201
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:08,635
And don't you worry
about anything.

1202
01:16:08,669 --> 01:16:10,270
Hello, Terrance.

1203
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,409
Sorry, did I shock you?

1204
01:16:15,442 --> 01:16:18,078
Drop the gun.

1205
01:16:18,112 --> 01:16:20,013
Drop the gun, now!

1206
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:21,515
You piece of shit.

1207
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:23,484
Are you too stupid to die?

1208
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:26,220
You've been chasing me
for ten years. For what?

1209
01:16:26,253 --> 01:16:28,122
I'm a little ocd.

1210
01:16:28,155 --> 01:16:29,656
I gotta finish what I start.

1211
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:33,093
I gotta admit,
changing your face threw me off.

1212
01:16:33,127 --> 01:16:36,997
Once I had your prints,
I knew I had you.

1213
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,536
I have no idea who this is.

1214
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,375
I'm taking you in.

1215
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:50,210
No, I got other plans.

1216
01:16:53,247 --> 01:16:54,982
And what are you gonna do?

1217
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:56,526
What are you gonna shoot me
in front of my son?

1218
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:58,252
Doesn't need to get messy.

1219
01:16:58,285 --> 01:17:00,320
Just tell the boy to step aside.

1220
01:17:00,354 --> 01:17:03,123
You go, son. You go to the
boat, I'll be right behind you.

1221
01:17:04,425 --> 01:17:05,726
- No.
- No, no...

1222
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:07,070
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

1223
01:17:07,094 --> 01:17:08,395
You go.

1224
01:17:08,429 --> 01:17:10,364
I got him covered,
he's not gonna hurt you.

1225
01:17:10,397 --> 01:17:13,600
Your dad's right.
I won't hurt you.

1226
01:17:13,634 --> 01:17:17,271
But he already has.
Worse than you know.

1227
01:17:17,304 --> 01:17:19,006
Don't you listen to him.

1228
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,675
Did he ever tell you
how your mom died?

1229
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:23,644
They found his prints
on her throat.

1230
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:25,279
He's a fucking liar.

1231
01:17:25,312 --> 01:17:28,348
She threatened to leave
and take you with her.

1232
01:17:28,382 --> 01:17:31,118
He killed her,
changed your names,

1233
01:17:31,151 --> 01:17:32,686
stayed on the run.

1234
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,555
Don't listen to him.
Just don't listen to him.

1235
01:17:34,588 --> 01:17:36,990
Sorry kid, it's true.

1236
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:41,128
Go to the boat!
Just go to the boat. Go!

1237
01:17:43,096 --> 01:17:44,364
No.

1238
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,442
Ern!

1239
01:18:00,815 --> 01:18:03,150
- Come here. You're safe.
- Come on!

1240
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:04,823
- You're safe. You're safe.
- Here you go.

1241
01:18:09,389 --> 01:18:12,326
Dad! Dad! Come on.

1242
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:20,634
Dad.

1243
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:22,202
Just let me be.

1244
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:31,612
Get down!

1245
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:42,089
- Fuck!
- No, no, don't move.

1246
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,663
Don't let that bastard
run again.

1247
01:18:49,696 --> 01:18:51,498
Take the shot for me.

1248
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:57,571
Take the shot.

1249
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:02,075
He's almost out of range.

1250
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:05,813
Take it!

1251
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:12,820
Kill him, Ryan!

1252
01:19:12,854 --> 01:19:15,122
I said I'd bring him in.

1253
01:19:35,742 --> 01:19:39,580
Dad? Dad! Dad!

1254
01:19:45,619 --> 01:19:48,655
He's gone. He's gone.

1255
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:52,626
Come on.

1256
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:54,261
Get up.

1257
01:20:06,908 --> 01:20:08,642
Sergeant.

1258
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:11,778
Savannah, what in god's name
is going on here?

1259
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:15,549
Mr. Arlene Buckley is not
who he pretends to be.

1260
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:52,920
How you doing?

1261
01:20:56,556 --> 01:20:58,325
Dad will be proud of you.

1262
01:21:00,494 --> 01:21:01,728
I'm proud of you too.

1263
01:21:30,424 --> 01:21:34,996
A blessing, to all our friends,
both old and new.

1264
01:21:35,029 --> 01:21:38,900
You are a part
of paliuli village now.

1265
01:21:38,933 --> 01:21:42,335
Today, we honor those
who gave their lives

1266
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:43,971
to protect us.

1267
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:47,909
Our beloved kahuna Charlie,

1268
01:21:47,942 --> 01:21:50,544
the young warrior koa,

1269
01:21:50,577 --> 01:21:52,479
and your father, young Swann.

1270
01:21:52,512 --> 01:21:55,449
May he live on
through your good deeds.

1271
01:21:55,482 --> 01:21:58,618
For donating your share
of the bounty

1272
01:21:58,652 --> 01:22:00,754
so we can rebuild our village

1273
01:22:00,787 --> 01:22:04,558
and care for the families
of the victims.

1274
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:07,327
We are all in your debt.

1275
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:09,763
- Mahalo.
- Mahalo.

1276
01:22:13,034 --> 01:22:15,368
You did that, Ryan?

1277
01:22:15,402 --> 01:22:18,405
Ah, it just felt like
the right thing to do.

1278
01:22:18,438 --> 01:22:20,340
I mean, I kept 10%.

1279
01:22:20,373 --> 01:22:22,442
Leaves me enough
for a new start.

1280
01:22:22,476 --> 01:22:23,911
But what about you?

1281
01:22:23,945 --> 01:22:25,980
You okay now
after all we've been through.

1282
01:22:26,013 --> 01:22:29,716
I'm a little shook up

01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,785
I just feel at peace.

1284
01:22:31,819 --> 01:22:35,689

anyone anymore.

01:22:35,722 --> 01:22:40,962

01:22:40,995 --> 01:22:45,032

wouldn't it?

1287
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:04,785
Ah, shall we?
